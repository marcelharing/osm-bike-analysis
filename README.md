## Installation
It is recommended to load the notebooks via Google Colab or Binder. This makes them executable on the server side and eliminates the need for a complex installation.

If you want to install it on your own computer, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and some libraries must be installed. The exact requirements can be found in the ``environment.yml`` file. This file can be used to create a new environment in anaconda prompt when entering:

``conda env create -f environment.yml``
